<!-- Hello, I am Min! I was a Data Science Intern at [iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/about-irobot/careers/data-science-and-machine-learning) where I conducted the analysis and built a scoring model for customer behavior with enterprise-level IoT data. I was also a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Quantrend Technology](https://quantrend.ai/) where I developed machine-learning based quantitative trading strategies and built a modular Reinforcement Learning codebase. -->

Hello, I am Min! I am currently an M.S. student from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) and will be graduating in **May 2021**. I work with Professor Chenhui Shao at the Automation and Digital Manufacturing Lab in the fields of data science, machine learning, and their applications in manufacturing. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/).

<!-- Some people may wonder why I switched from mechanical engineering to data science. In fact, it was the engineering background helps me to discover my interests in data science. As an engineer, we need to make sure things work well with theory and experimental data. With models and hypothesis testing, aren't we doing the same as a data scientist? -->

I am excited to explore new areas. This is why I had experiences in a broad range of fields from my previous positions and coursework including predictive maintenance, signal processing, time-series prediction, recommendation system, image object detection, etc. Please checkout my resume and project page!

I expect I will be a "Full-stack data scientist" in 3 years, which means I could independently create business ideas, generate hypotheses, setup data pipeline, conduct analysis, give insights to stakeholders, and deploy & monitor models in production.
