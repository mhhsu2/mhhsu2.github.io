<!-- Hello, I am Min! I was a Data Science Intern at [iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/about-irobot/careers/data-science-and-machine-learning) where I conducted the analysis and built a scoring model for customer behavior with enterprise-level IoT data. I was also a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Quantrend Technology](https://quantrend.ai/) where I developed machine-learning based quantitative trading strategies and built a modular Reinforcement Learning codebase. -->

<!-- Hello, I am Min! I am currently an M.S. student from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) and will be graduating in **May 2021**. I work with Professor Chenhui Shao at the Automation and Digital Manufacturing Lab in the fields of data science, machine learning, and their applications in manufacturing. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/). -->

<!-- Some people may wonder why I switched from mechanical engineering to data science. In fact, it was the engineering background helps me to discover my interests in data science. As an engineer, we need to make sure things work well with theory and experimental data. With models and hypothesis testing, aren't we doing the same as a data scientist? -->

I am excited to explore new areas and passionate about building cool stuff. This is why I am pursuing a career in software engineering and eager to leverage my experience from being a data scientist and machine learning engineer to help collaboration in a diverse team.
